## Project Goal

Meet Your Pet project aims to match dogs with their best caretakers, bridging the gap between pets at different adoption centers and people seeking different breeds of dogs. By allowing users to upload images of dogs, helps the user to know if the dog is good for them by knowing the breed of the dog and a small description about the features of the dog. If the dog is available at any adoption center, the platform also offers information about the adoption center to potential dog owners. Through this process, Meet Your Pet strives to facilitate meaningful connections between dogs in need of homes and individuals eager to provide them with care and companionship.

## Current Status and Future Plans

At present, the Meet Your Pet project is equipped to predict the breed of a dog based on uploaded images and provide a short description of the breed. However, our journey doesn't end here. Our aim to connect the users with the adoption centers is not yet fully implemented.We'll shortly implement it.Through these enhancements, we aim to make the adoption process seamless and efficient, ensuring that every dog finds a loving and caring home. Stay tuned for updates as we work towards this goal!
