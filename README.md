## About
Meet Your Pet is a `web application` powered by `machine learning` algorithms that predict the breed of a dog based on uploaded images. Whether you're curious about the any breed dog or want to identify the breed of a new rescue, Meet Your Pet offers a convenient and accurate solution.

# Running Meet Your Pet

**Meet Your Pet** consists of two main components: the backend and the frontend. The backend handles the machine learning algorithms and prediction logic, while the frontend provides the user interface for interacting with the system.

## Running the Backend

### Setup

1. Navigate to the `Backend` directory:

```
cd Meet_Your_Pet/Backend
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Starting the Server

3. Run the backend server:

```
python app.py
```

The backend server should now be running and ready to handle requests.

## Running the Frontend

### Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

```
cd Meet_Your_Pet/frontend
```

2. Install the required Node.js packages:

```
npm install
```

### Starting the Development Server

3. Start the development server for the frontend:

```
npm run dev
```

## Project Goal
The Meet Your Pet project is started with the aim to match dogs with their best caretakers, bridging the gap between pets at different adoption centers and people seeking different breeds of dogs. By allowing users to upload images of dogs, the system predicts the breed of the dog and provides a short description. If the dog is available at any adoption center, the platform also offers information about the adoption center to potential dog owners. Through this process, Meet Your Pet strives to facilitate meaningful connections between dogs in need of homes and individuals eager to provide them with care and companionship.

## Current Status and Future Plans

At present, the Meet Your Pet project is equipped to predict the breed of a dog based on uploaded images and provide a short description of the breed. However, our journey doesn't end here. We are committed to enhancing the platform to facilitate connections between adoption centers and individuals seeking dogs. In the near future, we plan to implement features that will enable users to view adoption center information for dogs they are interested in. Through these enhancements, we aim to make the adoption process seamless and efficient, ensuring that every dog finds a loving and caring home. Stay tuned for updates as we work towards this goal!
